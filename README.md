This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router Dom v6's `useSearchParams` hook.  When initializing the hook with an empty string '', instead of the expected empty array [], the hook fails silently. This can cause unexpected behavior in applications that rely on search parameters. The solution shows how to properly initialize the hook using an empty array and clarifies the expected input type.
